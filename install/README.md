### Installation
Since i'm traveling a lot between work stations, i wanted an easy method to install the script (Yes i just can git pull). But this will also setup the database and default users.

Just run the index.php (you may open it on your server or run in via console via  `./install destination` ) This will install it with default settings (once you have them set up)




Micro is light, we are able to keep a clean version beside the live version. This results in easy debugging and development.

The installer will simply copy and paste the SRC folder to your prefered folder
